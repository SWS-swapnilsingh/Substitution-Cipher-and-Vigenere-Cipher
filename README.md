# Vigenere Cipher Project

This Python script provides a suite of functions for cryptographic analysis, focusing on the Vigenère cipher and substitution cipher techniques. Here's an overview of its capabilities and real-world applications:

## Features

- **Substitution Cipher Analysis**: Includes functions to encrypt and decrypt text using a predefined substitution cipher mapping. It also performs frequency analysis to predict the mapping used in encryption.
  
- **Vigenère Cipher Analysis**: Implements methods to encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenère cipher with a specified password. It includes functionalities to determine the length of the password and perform decryption based on frequency analysis.

- **Cryptanalysis Functions**: Provides tools to analyze encrypted texts, predict encryption keys or passwords, and decrypt the text using both statistical frequency analysis and known plaintext attacks.

## Real-World Applications

- **Security Analysis**: Useful in cybersecurity and digital forensics for analyzing encrypted communications and data. It helps security analysts understand encryption techniques and weaknesses in encrypted messages.

- **Historical Cryptanalysis**: Valuable in historical studies to decipher ancient texts encrypted with substitution or Vigenère ciphers, offering insights into historical events or encrypted manuscripts.

- **Educational Purposes**: Benefits students and educators studying cryptography by providing hands-on tools to explore and understand fundamental encryption and decryption techniques.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and ensure Python 3.x is installed with required dependencies (`re`, `string`).

2. **Execution**: Run the script to encrypt, decrypt, or analyze text files using Vigenère and substitution cipher methods.

3. **Customization**: Modify input files, encryption parameters, and encryption mappings to adapt the script for specific cryptographic tasks or educational purposes.
